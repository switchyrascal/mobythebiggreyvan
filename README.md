## Introduction
This repo contains some (not all!) of the files and data used for upfitting
Moby. For more information see

FreeCAD was used for designing all the parts, Fusion360 was used for all
toolpath generation and machining. I have tried to make sure that the files are
accurate and up-to-date, they are for the parts as-built. In total, Moby took
about 5000 hours from start to finish; about 2000 hours of design and prep work
and about 3000 hours to build. Anyhow, if you've managed to find this repo I
hope you find it useful!
